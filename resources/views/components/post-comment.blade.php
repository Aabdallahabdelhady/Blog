                                BBOT uses a recursive model similar to Spiderfoot which is one of the reasons for its higher subdomain yield
                                and subsequently higher runtime. But even considering the higher runtime, it severely outperformed Spiderfoot
                                for the purposes of subdomain enumeration, as seen in both of the above charts. In our testing, we let Spiderfoot 
                                run for 48 hours, after which we were forced to cancel it.BBOT uses a recursive model similar to Spiderfoot which
